                    Kingdom is an ongoing anime series that started in 2012. So far 18 episodes of Kingdom have been aired. Kingdom has no reported filler.<br><br>Born in the Warring States period of ancient China, Xin and Piao are war-orphans in the
                    kingdom of Qin who dream of becoming "Great Generals of the Heavens" to rise from their lowly stations in life. One day, however, Piao is taken to the palace by a minister to be used for an unknown purpose, leaving Xin alone as a household
                    slave in a peasant village. A few months later, Piao returns to the village on the verge of death, urging Xin to travel to another village. There he meets a boy who looks nearly identical to Piao, Ying Zheng, the current King of Qin.
                    Xin learns that Piao served as a body double for Ying Zheng, and was mortally wounded in a power struggle for the throne. Though initially furious at Ying Zheng for causing Piao\'s death, Xin decides to seize the opportunity and aid
                    Ying Zheng in defeating his brother and reclaiming the Qin throne. Successful in this endeavor, Xin officially starts his life as a Qin commander on the battlefields of Warring States China with the goal of becoming the "Greatest General
                    in the World", and to help King Zheng of Qin achieve his dream of total unification, ending the incessant warfare once and for all.
