                <p>
                    Kuroko’s Basketball was an anime series that ran from 2012 to 2015. In total 75 episodes of Kuroko’s Basketball were aired. Kuroko’s Basketball has no reported filler.<br><br>Teikou Middle School is famous for its highly renowned basketball
                    team, which produced the famed "Generation of Miracles": a team of five prodigies, each with their own unique abilities, considered to be undefeatable by the time they became third years. However, blinded by pride, they split up, entering
                    different high schools upon graduation.<br><br>Taiga Kagami, having just returned from America, joins the basketball team at Seirin High School in search of strong team members. There, he finds Tetsuya Kuroko, a seemingly unimpressive
                    player, only for Kagami to find out that Kuroko was the "Phantom Sixth Member" of the Generation of Miracles: an invisible player who used his impeccable passing skills to support the team from the shadows. Together, they resolve to
                    defeat the Generation of Miracles and make the Seirin basketball team the best in Japan.
